Skin cancer images classification using customized model and pretrained model
The first file uses customized deep learning model for skin cancer clsiification which gives 93% accuracy after 100 epoc and trained on 2600 x-ray images.
The second file uses ResNet50 to classify the same images (the first 60 layer is frozen and the rest only is trainable)> it gives 90% accuracy after training on 2600 images.
